Not in a way that people could abviously tell... but in a very coniving and sneaky way, the way that no one else will know that it is even benefitting me and maybe it even makes me look like I AM the one who is sacrificing...I would never have passed that opportunity up. Like I was saying, I was beyond selfish, solely self-seeking I would even say. Pretty dark, it makes me emotional even thinking about it. I hurt many undeserving people and for this I am sorry",
